## Problem Section
| Element | Copy |
|---------|------|
| Badge | The Real Problem |
| Headline | You've Done Everything Right. Dating Still Doesn't Work. |
| Subhead | You're successful. You know what you want. So why is this so hard? |

**Pain Points:**
1. **You're not looking for hookups. But that's all apps deliver.** — Endless swiping, zero serious prospects.
2. **Dates that look good on paper. Zero chemistry in person.** — Another wasted evening. Another dead end.
3. **Compatibility? You won't know until you're 3 months in.** — By then, you've already invested everything.
4. **You've tried everything. Same result.** — Hinge. Bumble. Raya. Nothing works.

## Imagine Section

| Headline | Before the First Date, You'll Know: |

**Points:**
1. **Their communication style** — And whether it matches yours
2. **How they handle conflict** — And if you're compatible under stress
3. **What they actually need** — Not what their bio says
4. **Why you'd work together** — Backed by 30 years of science

| Title | Founder & CEO |

**Journey Steps:**
1. **The Problem** — 3 years on apps, nothing to show
2. **The Discovery** — Found Dr. Zannah's 30-year research
3. **The Insight** — Science solves what swiping can't
4. **The Solution** — Built the app I needed

## FAQ Section
| Element | Copy |
|---------|------|
| Headline | Questions? We've Got Answers. |

**Questions & Answers:**

**Q: How is AILO different from dating apps?**
A: Dating apps show you everyone nearby and let you guess. We use patented behavioral science to only show you people you're actually compatible with. Fewer matches, but matches that make sense.

**Q: What happens after I complete the questionnaire?**
A: You'll book a strategy call with our team. We'll answer your questions and see if AILO is right for you. After joining, you'll complete the full Discovery Assessment in the app.

**Q: How long until I see matches?**
A: Most members receive their first matches within 7-14 days of completing the assessment. Timing depends on our current pool and your compatibility profile.

**Q: What's the investment?**
A: Traditional matchmakers charge $15,000-50,000 with no guarantees. AILO membership is a one-time investment of $999-1,499 depending on your situation — we'll discuss options on your call. Unlike monthly subscriptions, you pay once and keep access forever, including future matches, events, and all app updates.

**Q: I'm not in South Florida. Can I use AILO?**
A: We're currently matching in South Florida only. Join the waitlist and you'll get priority access when we expand to your area.

**Q: What if I don't get matches?**
A: That's what the 90-Day Guarantee is for. If you don't receive at least 3 compatible matches within 90 days, you get AILO Duo free for life plus VIP access to all our events.
